                    <p>I can't stop raving about my Shark HyperAIR hair dryer. I am both impressed and in love with it. This is literally the best hair dryer I have ever used! The hair dryer itself is compact and pretty lightweight. It fits nicely in my hand, and is easy and comfortable to hold. It comes with two attachments, a 2-in-1 concentrator and a styling brush, both work amazing. The ...</p>

                    <p>This is a super luxe hair dryer. The design is beautiful but also simple. Easy to hold and not too heavy. There is only an on/off switch on the handle- the rest are on the back of the dryer. You can select different levels of heat and air. Heat levels are very noticeably different, so it’s nice to have the options. It’s not very quiet and almost whiny. Not an appealing sound, so...</p>

                    <p>This is the best hair dryer I’ve ever had hands down! I have wavy hair so I use the diffuser the most and my drying time reduced from 45min to only 10/15min which is AMAZING for me! I also used the brush to straighten my hair for the first time in 2 years and absolutely loved the result, how smooth my hair was and how fast I could do it too! The only reason I’m not ...</p>

                    <p>So I've had this blow dryer about a month now. The dry time is definitely the best feature about this dryer. It's about a 10 to 15 min difference than the Dyson. BUT when using the precision concentrator is leave the hair looking as if I've teased it and it's frizzy around the root area. I'm a cosmetologist and this doesn't help me what so ever! Not only does it leave the root...</p>

                    <p>I purchased it hoping it will be so good for my hair. And I love the power of it, but the same powerful air makes attachments fly away and fall on the floor. This morning, I again tried to dry my hair with brush attachment and it fell off 3 times, it sounds pretty loud on the tile floor:) I am not sure if I am doing something wrong but this happens with all the attachments...</p>
